# API Design Best Practices Research

**Date:** 2024-09-13
**Topic:** RESTful API Design Patterns
**Source:** Multiple online resources and documentation

## Key Findings

### REST Principles
The core principles of REST architecture include:
- Stateless communication
- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP methods for operations
- Representation through JSON/XML

### Best Practices
1. Use consistent naming conventions
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Version your APIs appropriately
4. Document everything thoroughly

## Implementation Notes
- [ ] Review current API against these principles
- [ ] Update documentation format
- [ ] Implement consistent error responses
- [x] Research completed successfully

## References
- REST API Design Guide (restful-api-design.com)
- HTTP Status Codes Reference
- JSON API Specification

This research will help improve our API design standards and guide future development decisions.
