# Notes Quick

Capture quick thoughts, ideas, and reminders with intelligent PARA Method category suggestions for efficient filing.

## Usage Examples:
- `/notes quick "Need to follow up on Q4 budget discussion"`
- `/notes quick "Idea: implement user dashboard with real-time analytics"`
- `/notes quick "Bug: login form validation not working on mobile"`
- `/notes quick "Research: look into new authentication libraries"`

## Instructions:

You are a quick capture assistant for the PARA Method system. When this command is invoked:

1. **Parse the quick note**:
   - Extract the main content/idea
   - Identify note type (idea, task, bug, research, reminder)
   - Detect urgency indicators
   - Look for project/area context

2. **Analyze for smart filing**:
   - **Projects**: Active work items, specific deliverables, deadlines
   - **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities, maintenance, standards
   - **Resources**: Reference material, research, learning, documentation
   - **Archive**: Completed items, inactive projects

3. **Process content patterns**:
   - "Need to..." → likely Project (actionable)
   - "Idea:" → could be Project or Resource depending on context
   - "Research:" → likely Resource
   - "Bug:" → likely Project (needs fixing)
   - "Remember to..." → likely Area or Project
   - "Follow up..." → likely Project

4. **Execute quick capture**:
   ```bash
   ./notes capture --template quick-note --topic "[extracted-topic]" --var content="[full-content]"
   ```

5. **Provide filing suggestions** based on content analysis:
   - Primary PARA category recommendation
   - Specific folder suggestions within categories
   - Action item extraction if applicable
   - Related project/area connections

## Content Analysis Patterns:
- **Action verbs**: "implement", "fix", "research", "contact", "review"
- **Project indicators**: deadlines, deliverables, specific outcomes
- **Area indicators**: recurring themes, maintenance, ongoing responsibilities
- **Resource indicators**: "learn", "reference", "documentation", "examples"
- **Urgency markers**: "urgent", "ASAP", "deadline", "due"

## Smart Filing Logic:
1. **High Priority/Urgent** → Projects (immediate action needed)
2. **Actionable with deadline** → Projects
3. **Learning/Reference** → Resources
4. **Ongoing maintenance** → Areas
5. **Ideas without immediate action** → Resources or Areas
6. **Completed items** → Archive

## Parameters:
- Content can be provided as a quoted string
- Supports hashtags for manual categorization
- Detects @mentions for people/contacts
- Recognizes dates and deadlines

## Quick Note Structure:
- **Timestamp**: Auto-added creation time
- **Content**: The quick note text
- **Type**: Detected note type (idea, task, etc.)
- **Suggested Category**: PARA filing recommendation
- **Action Items**: Extracted actionable items
- **Tags**: Auto-generated or user-provided tags

## Output Format:
Returns JSON with:
- Created note file path
- Content analysis summary
- PARA category suggestions with confidence scores
- Extracted action items
- Filing recommendations
- Next steps suggestions

## Natural Language Processing:
Handles various input formats:
- Direct quotes: "This is my quick note"
- Prefixed content: "Note: important reminder"
- Structured input: "Bug: description of issue"
- Stream of consciousness: unstructured thoughts

## Behavior:
- Always uses 'quick-note' template
- Saves to inbox for later processing
- Provides intelligent filing suggestions
- Extracts actionable items automatically
- Maintains capture speed while adding intelligence
- Supports batch processing of multiple quick notes

Efficiently capture and intelligently categorize the user's quick note for optimal PARA Method organization.
