# Learn Review

Conduct systematic reviews of learning progress, analyze captured insights, identify knowledge gaps, and generate actionable recommendations for continued growth and knowledge application.

## Usage Examples:
- `/learn review --type weekly --goal ai-agent-architecture`
- `/learn review --comprehensive --since 2024-09-01`
- `/learn review captures --category technical --limit 20`
- `/learn review progress --learning-pathway ai_engineer`
- `/learn review gaps --goal para-method-mastery --recommendations`

## Instructions:

You are a learning review assistant for the PARA Method learning system. When this command is invoked:

1. **Determine review scope and type**:
   - **Weekly/Monthly Reviews**: Regular progress assessments
   - **Goal Reviews**: Focus on specific learning goals
   - **Capture Reviews**: Analysis of recent insights and concepts
   - **Gap Analysis**: Identify learning gaps and missing connections
   - **Comprehensive**: Full learning portfolio assessment

2. **Load and analyze learning data**:
   ```bash
   # Load learning data for analysis
   python3 -c "
   import json, yaml, datetime
   from pathlib import Path
   from collections import defaultdict, Counter

   # Load configuration files
   goals_file = Path('.claude/learning_goals.yaml')
   sources_file = Path('.claude/sources.yaml')
   captures_file = Path('.claude/cache/learning_captures.json')

   goals_data = yaml.safe_load(goals_file.read_text()) if goals_file.exists() else {}
   sources_data = yaml.safe_load(sources_file.read_text()) if sources_file.exists() else {}
   captures_data = json.loads(captures_file.read_text()) if captures_file.exists() else {'captures': []}

   # Perform analysis based on review type
   review_type = '${review_type}'
   review_scope = '${review_scope}'

   print(f'üìä Learning Review: {review_type.title()}')
   print('=' * 50)
   "
   ```

3. **Generate review analysis**:

   **Progress Analysis**:
   - Learning goal completion percentages
   - Milestone achievement rates
   - Timeline adherence assessment
   - Skill development tracking
   - Application implementation rates

   **Content Analysis**:
   - Capture frequency and patterns
   - Source utilization effectiveness
   - Knowledge category distribution
   - Tag usage and clustering
   - Connection density mapping

   **Gap Identification**:
   - Underutilized sources
   - Incomplete learning pathways
   - Missing skill connections
   - Abandoned or stalled goals
   - Low-application insights

4. **Provide actionable insights**:
   - Priority adjustments needed
   - Resource reallocation recommendations
   - Timeline modifications
   - Focus area suggestions
   - Application opportunities

5. **Generate review report**:
   ```bash
   # Generate comprehensive review report
   python3 -c "
   import json, yaml, datetime
   from pathlib import Path

   # Create review report structure
   report = {
       'review_id': f'review-{datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S\")}',
       'timestamp': datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
       'type': '${review_type}',
       'scope': '${review_scope}',
       'period': '${review_period}',
       'summary': {
           'total_captures': 0,
           'active_goals': 0,
           'completed_milestones': 0,
           'sources_utilized': 0,
           'applications_implemented': 0
       },
       'progress_highlights': [],
       'areas_for_improvement': [],
       'recommendations': [],
       'next_actions': []
   }

   # Save review report
   reviews_file = Path('.claude/cache/learning_reviews.json')
   reviews_data = json.loads(reviews_file.read_text()) if reviews_file.exists() else {'reviews': []}
   reviews_data['reviews'].append(report)

   reviews_file.parent.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
   reviews_file.write_text(json.dumps(reviews_data, indent=2))

   print(f'üìã Review completed: {report[\"review_id\"]}')
   "
   ```
