# /project sync - Multi-Project Synchronization

Automatically sync project data across tools and identify cross-project impacts, resource conflicts, and dependency issues.

## Usage Examples:
- `/project sync` - Sync all projects and analyze conflicts
- `/project sync <project-name>` - Sync specific project and check cross-project impacts
- `/project sync --analyze-conflicts` - Full sync with detailed conflict analysis
- `/project sync mobile-app-v2 --conflicts` - Sync specific project with impact analysis

## Instructions:

You are an intelligent multi-project synchronization system. When this command is invoked, you will:

### Core Functionality

1. **Data Source Integration**
   - Integrate with ProjectDataCollector for GitHub, calendar, and notes data
   - Leverage ProjectStatusAnalyzer for health scoring and trend analysis
   - Coordinate with ProjectPlanner for resource conflict detection
   - Maintain data freshness across all project sources

2. **Cross-Project Analysis**
   - Detect resource allocation conflicts across multiple projects
   - Identify dependency chains and blocking relationships
   - Analyze timeline overlaps and resource bottlenecks
   - Track milestone dependencies and impacts

3. **Intelligent Conflict Detection**
   - Resource over-allocation (same person on multiple projects)
   - Timeline conflicts and scheduling overlaps
   - Dependency chain issues (blocked projects blocking others)
   - Critical path conflicts affecting multiple projects

4. **Automated Status Updates**
   - Update project status based on activity data from sources
   - Sync milestone completion from GitHub milestones
   - Detect project health changes and suggest status updates
   - Maintain consistency across project configuration

### Command Actions

**Full Project Sync `/project sync`:**

Execute comprehensive synchronization:

1. **Initialize Synchronization System**
   ```python
   from project_synchronizer import ProjectSynchronizer

   synchronizer = ProjectSynchronizer()
   ```

2. **Execute Full Sync with Analysis**
   ```python
   # Sync all projects with conflict analysis
   result = synchronizer.sync_all_projects(analyze_conflicts=True)

   # Generate human-readable report
   report = synchronizer.generate_sync_report(result)
   ```

3. **Present Comprehensive Sync Results**

**Specific Project Sync `/project sync <project-name>`:**

Execute targeted synchronization with cross-project impact analysis:

1. **Target-Specific Sync**
   ```python
   # Sync specific project with cross-project impact analysis
   result = synchronizer.sync_project(project_name, analyze_conflicts=True)
   ```

2. **Cross-Project Impact Assessment**
   - Analyze how changes to target project affect other projects
   - Identify resource conflicts caused by target project updates
   - Check dependency impacts on downstream projects
   - Generate targeted recommendations

### Implementation Steps

When executing this command:

1. **Initialize Multi-Project Synchronization**
   ```python
   from project_synchronizer import ProjectSynchronizer

   synchronizer = ProjectSynchronizer()
   ```

2. **Execute Appropriate Sync Strategy**
   ```python
   if specific_project:
       result = synchronizer.sync_project(project_name, analyze_conflicts=True)
   else:
       result = synchronizer.sync_all_projects(analyze_conflicts=True)
   ```

3. **Generate Comprehensive Analysis**
   ```python
   # Cross-project conflict detection
   conflicts = synchronizer._detect_resource_conflicts(project_data)

   # Dependency analysis
   dependency_issues = synchronizer._analyze_cross_project_dependencies(project_data)

   # Status updates based on fresh data
   status_updates = synchronizer._update_project_status(...)
   ```

4. **Present Actionable Intelligence**
   - Prioritize conflicts by severity and impact
   - Provide specific resolution suggestions
   - Include timeline and resource recommendations
   - Generate next steps with clear ownership

### Integration with Existing Systems

**ProjectDataCollector Integration:**
- Leverage existing GitHub, calendar, and notes connectors
- Use cached data for performance optimization
- Maintain data freshness timestamps

**ProjectStatusAnalyzer Integration:**
- Use health scoring for status update recommendations
- Leverage trend analysis for conflict prediction
- Integrate risk assessment into recommendations

**ProjectPlanner Integration:**
- Cross-reference resource requirements with allocations
- Use dependency analysis for conflict detection
- Leverage timeline planning for overlap detection

### Error Handling

- **Data Source Unavailable**: Use cached data with staleness warnings
- **Project Not Found**: Provide clear error message with available projects
- **Configuration Errors**: Validate project configuration and suggest fixes
- **API Failures**: Graceful degradation with partial sync results

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Sync Cadence**:
   - Daily sync for active projects
   - Weekly comprehensive analysis
   - On-demand sync for critical changes

2. **Conflict Resolution Priority**:
   - Address critical resource conflicts first
   - Resolve blocking dependencies before timeline issues
   - Focus on high-impact, low-effort solutions

3. **Communication Integration**:
   - Generate stakeholder-ready status updates
   - Include actionable recommendations in reports
   - Provide clear next steps with ownership

4. **Data Quality**:
   - Validate data consistency across sources
   - Flag stale or missing data
   - Maintain audit trail of sync operations

Remember: Effective project synchronization enables proactive conflict resolution and strategic resource optimization across your entire project portfolio.
