# /project sync - Multi-Project Synchronization

Automatically sync project data across tools and identify cross-project impacts, resource conflicts, and dependency issues.

## Usage Examples:
- `/project sync` - Sync all projects and analyze conflicts
- `/project sync <project-name>` - Sync specific project and check cross-project impacts
- `/project sync --analyze-conflicts` - Full sync with detailed conflict analysis
- `/project sync mobile-app-v2 --conflicts` - Sync specific project with impact analysis

## Instructions:

You are an intelligent multi-project synchronization system. When this command is invoked, you will:

### Core Functionality

1. **Data Source Integration**
   - Use DataCollector tool for multi-source data (GitHub, calendar, notes, team)
   - Automatic 5-minute caching for performance optimization
   - Type-safe data access through Pydantic models
   - Automatic retry and graceful degradation for reliability

2. **Cross-Project Analysis**
   - Detect resource allocation conflicts across multiple projects
   - Identify dependency chains and blocking relationships
   - Analyze timeline overlaps and resource bottlenecks
   - Track milestone dependencies and impacts

3. **Intelligent Conflict Detection**
   - Resource over-allocation (same person on multiple projects)
   - Timeline conflicts and scheduling overlaps
   - Dependency chain issues (blocked projects blocking others)
   - Critical path conflicts affecting multiple projects

4. **Automated Status Updates**
   - Update project status based on activity data from sources
   - Sync milestone completion from GitHub milestones
   - Detect project health changes and suggest status updates
   - Maintain consistency across project configuration

### Command Actions

**Full Project Sync `/project sync`:**

Execute comprehensive synchronization:

1. **Initialize Data Collection**
   ```python
   from tools import DataCollector, ConfigManager

   config = ConfigManager()
   collector = DataCollector(config)
   ```

2. **Collect and Analyze All Projects**
   ```python
   # Get all active projects
   all_projects = config.get_all_projects(filters={"status": ["active", "in_progress"]})

   # Collect data for all projects
   project_data = {}
   for project_id in all_projects:
       project_data[project_id] = collector.aggregate_project_data(
           project_id=project_id,
           sources=["github", "notes", "calendar", "team", "config"]
       )

   # Analyze cross-project conflicts and dependencies
   conflicts = detect_resource_conflicts(project_data, all_projects)
   dependency_issues = analyze_dependencies(project_data, all_projects)
   ```

3. **Present Comprehensive Sync Results**

**Specific Project Sync `/project sync <project-name>`:**

Execute targeted synchronization with cross-project impact analysis:

1. **Collect Target Project Data**
   ```python
   # Collect data for target project
   target_data = collector.aggregate_project_data(
       project_id=project_name,
       sources=["github", "notes", "calendar", "team", "config"]
   )

   # Collect data for all projects to analyze cross-project impacts
   all_projects = config.get_all_projects(filters={"status": ["active", "in_progress"]})
   all_project_data = {}
   for project_id in all_projects:
       if project_id != project_name:  # Already have target project data
           all_project_data[project_id] = collector.aggregate_project_data(
               project_id=project_id,
               sources=["github", "notes", "calendar", "team", "config"]
           )
   all_project_data[project_name] = target_data
   ```

2. **Cross-Project Impact Assessment**
   - Analyze how changes to target project affect other projects
   - Identify resource conflicts caused by target project updates
   - Check dependency impacts on downstream projects
   - Generate targeted recommendations

### Implementation Steps

When executing this command:

1. **Initialize Data Collection**
   ```python
   from tools import DataCollector, ConfigManager

   config = ConfigManager()
   collector = DataCollector(config)
   ```

2. **Collect Multi-Project Data**
   ```python
   # Determine scope
   if specific_project:
       projects_to_analyze = [specific_project]
       # But still need all projects for conflict detection
       all_projects = config.get_all_projects(filters={"status": ["active", "in_progress"]})
   else:
       all_projects = config.get_all_projects(filters={"status": ["active", "in_progress"]})
       projects_to_analyze = list(all_projects.keys())

   # Collect data for all projects (cached calls are fast)
   project_data_map = {}
   for project_id in all_projects:
       try:
           data = collector.aggregate_project_data(
               project_id=project_id,
               sources=["github", "notes", "calendar", "team", "config"]
           )
           project_data_map[project_id] = data
       except Exception as e:
           # Log error but continue with other projects
           print(f"Warning: Could not collect data for {project_id}: {e}")
   ```

3. **Analyze Cross-Project Conflicts and Dependencies**
   ```python
   # Resource conflict detection
   resource_conflicts = []
   for project_id, project_config in all_projects.items():
       owner = project_config.get('owner')
       timeline = project_config.get('timeline', {})

       # Check for resource over-allocation
       for other_id, other_config in all_projects.items():
           if other_id == project_id:
               continue
           if other_config.get('owner') == owner:
               # Check timeline overlap
               if timelines_overlap(timeline, other_config.get('timeline', {})):
                   resource_conflicts.append({
                       'resource': owner,
                       'projects': [project_id, other_id],
                       'type': 'time_overlap'
                   })

   # Dependency analysis
   dependency_issues = []
   for project_id, project_config in all_projects.items():
       dependencies = project_config.get('dependencies', [])
       for dep in dependencies:
           dep_config = all_projects.get(dep)
           if dep_config:
               dep_status = dep_config.get('status')
               # Check if dependency is blocking
               if dep_status in ['blocked', 'paused']:
                   dependency_issues.append({
                       'dependent_project': project_id,
                       'blocking_project': dep,
                       'issue_type': 'blocked'
                   })

   # Status updates based on activity data
   status_updates = []
   for project_id in projects_to_analyze:
       data = project_data_map.get(project_id)
       if data:
           # Check for milestone completions from GitHub
           if data.github_data and data.github_data.milestones:
               completed_milestones = [
                   m for m in data.github_data.milestones
                   if m.get('state') == 'closed'
               ]
               if completed_milestones:
                   status_updates.append({
                       'project': project_id,
                       'type': 'milestone_completion',
                       'milestones': completed_milestones
                   })
   ```

4. **Present Actionable Intelligence**
   - Prioritize conflicts by severity and impact
   - Provide specific resolution suggestions
   - Include timeline and resource recommendations
   - Generate next steps with clear ownership

### Error Handling & Performance

**DataCollector Benefits:**
- **Automatic Caching**: 5-minute cache dramatically reduces API/CLI calls
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with partial data when sources unavailable
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure data consistency across all projects

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Parallel Collection**: Multiple projects can be analyzed efficiently with caching
- **Response Time**: ~10s ‚Üí <2s for cached multi-project sync
- **Resource Usage**: Reduced API calls by ~80% with caching
- **Scalability**: Handles 10+ projects without performance degradation

**Error Scenarios:**
- **Data Source Unavailable**: Use cached data with staleness warnings, continue analysis
- **Project Not Found**: Provide clear error with available project list from ConfigManager
- **Configuration Errors**: Validate with ConfigManager, suggest fixes
- **API Failures**: Graceful degradation with partial sync results, detailed error messages
- **Individual Project Failure**: Skip failed project, continue with others, report errors

### Integration Notes

- **Performance**: Multi-project sync benefits most from caching (10s ‚Üí 2s)
- **Reliability**: Built-in error handling eliminates complex sync failure logic
- **Consistency**: Same data models used across all project commands
- **Maintainability**: Centralized data collection in tested tool (87% coverage)
- **Cross-Project Analysis**: Efficient conflict detection with cached project data

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Sync Cadence**:
   - Daily sync for active projects
   - Weekly comprehensive analysis
   - On-demand sync for critical changes

2. **Conflict Resolution Priority**:
   - Address critical resource conflicts first
   - Resolve blocking dependencies before timeline issues
   - Focus on high-impact, low-effort solutions

3. **Communication Integration**:
   - Generate stakeholder-ready status updates
   - Include actionable recommendations in reports
   - Provide clear next steps with ownership

4. **Data Quality**:
   - Validate data consistency across sources
   - Flag stale or missing data
   - Maintain audit trail of sync operations

Remember: Effective project synchronization enables proactive conflict resolution and strategic resource optimization across your entire project portfolio.
