# /project status - Intelligent Project Status Command

Comprehensive project status analysis that synthesizes data from multiple sources to provide actionable insights, health scoring, trend analysis, and risk identification.

## Usage Examples:
- `/project status` - Overview of all active projects with intelligent analysis
- `/project status <project-name>` - Detailed analysis of specific project
- `/project status --json` - JSON output for programmatic use
- `/project status --focus risks` - Focus on project risks and blockers
- `/project status --focus health` - Focus on project health metrics
- `/project status --focus trends` - Focus on trend analysis

## Instructions:

You are an intelligent project management analyst. When this command is invoked, you will:

### Core Functionality

1. **Multi-Source Data Collection**
   - Use the DataCollector tool from the tools package to gather data from:
     - GitHub API (PRs, issues, commits, milestones)
     - Notes system (project-related notes and action items)
     - Calendar integration (meetings, deadlines)
     - Team data (members, roles, availability)
   - Synthesize data from `.claude/projects.yaml` configuration
   - Integrate with `.claude/integrations.yaml` for API access
   - Automatic 5-minute caching for performance
   - Graceful degradation when data sources unavailable

2. **Intelligent Health Scoring**
   - Calculate project health score (0.0-1.0) based on:
     - **Timeline Progress** (0.3 weight): Milestone completion vs. elapsed time
     - **Activity Level** (0.25 weight): Recent GitHub commits, PRs, issue updates
     - **Blocker Status** (0.25 weight): Number and severity of blockers
     - **Dependency Health** (0.2 weight): Status of dependent projects
   - Health Categories:
     - 0.8-1.0: üü¢ Excellent (on track, active, minimal blockers)
     - 0.6-0.8: üü° Good (minor issues, manageable risks)
     - 0.4-0.6: üü† At Risk (significant concerns, needs attention)
     - 0.0-0.4: üî¥ Critical (major blockers, high risk of failure)

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - **Velocity Trends**: Compare recent activity vs. historical average
     - Increasing: Recent commits/PRs > 120% of average
     - Stable: Recent activity within 80-120% of average
     - Decreasing: Recent activity < 80% of average
   - **Risk Trends**: Track risk factors over time
     - Improving: Blockers resolved, milestones met
     - Stable: Consistent progress, predictable patterns
     - Declining: New blockers, missed milestones, reduced activity

4. **Blocker and Risk Identification**
   - **Automated Blocker Detection**:
     - Dependencies on incomplete projects
     - Overdue milestones
     - Stale GitHub repositories (no commits > 7 days)
     - Open high-priority issues
     - Missing environment variables for integrations
   - **Risk Assessment**:
     - Schedule Risk: Target date vs. remaining milestones
     - Resource Risk: Owner workload across projects
     - Technical Risk: High number of open bugs/issues
     - Dependency Risk: Blocking other projects

### Implementation Steps

When executing this command:

1. **Initialize Data Collection with NoteProcessor**
   ```python
   from tools import DataCollector, NoteProcessor, ConfigManager

   config = ConfigManager()
   collector = DataCollector(config)
   processor = NoteProcessor()  # For enhanced note operations
   ```

2. **Collect Project Data with Enhanced Note Operations**
   ```python
   if project_name:
       # Collect data for specific project from all sources
       project_data = collector.aggregate_project_data(
           project_id=project_name,
           sources=["github", "notes", "calendar", "team", "config"]
       )

       # Enhanced note operations with NoteProcessor
       # Get detailed project notes (type-safe ParsedNote objects)
       project_notes = processor.get_project_notes(project_name)

       # Get action items by status (simplified from DataCollector)
       pending_actions = processor.get_action_items_by_status("pending", project=project_name)
       overdue_actions = processor.get_action_items_by_status("overdue", project=project_name)
       completed_actions = processor.get_action_items_by_status("completed", project=project_name)

       # Access collected data from DataCollector
       github_data = project_data.github_data
       notes_data = project_data.notes_data  # Basic note count and summaries
       calendar_data = project_data.calendar_data
       team_data = project_data.team_data
       config_data = project_data.config_data

       # Combine for comprehensive analysis
       detailed_notes_analysis = {
           'total_notes': len(project_notes),
           'pending_actions': len(pending_actions),
           'overdue_actions': len(overdue_actions),
           'completed_actions': len(completed_actions),
           'action_completion_rate': len(completed_actions) / (len(completed_actions) + len(pending_actions)) if (len(completed_actions) + len(pending_actions)) > 0 else 0
       }
   else:
       # Collect data for all active projects
       all_projects = config.get_all_projects(filters={"status": ["active", "in_progress"]})
       project_data = {}
       for project_id in all_projects:
           project_data[project_id] = collector.aggregate_project_data(
               project_id=project_id,
               sources=["github", "notes", "calendar", "team", "config"]
           )

           # Enhanced note analysis per project
           project_data[project_id].notes_detail = {
               'notes': processor.get_project_notes(project_id),
               'pending_actions': processor.get_action_items_by_status("pending", project=project_id),
               'overdue_actions': processor.get_action_items_by_status("overdue", project=project_id)
           }
   ```

3. **Calculate Health Scores**
   - Timeline Progress: (completed_milestones / total_milestones) * (days_elapsed / total_days)
   - Activity Level: Normalize recent GitHub activity (commits, PRs, issues)
   - Blocker Impact: Penalize based on number and severity of blockers
   - Dependency Health: Factor in dependency project health scores

4. **Perform Trend Analysis**
   - Compare recent activity vs. 30-day rolling average
   - Analyze milestone completion velocity
   - Track blocker resolution rate

5. **Generate Insights**
   - Identify common patterns across projects
   - Suggest optimization opportunities
   - Highlight resource allocation issues

6. **Format Output**
   - Default: Human-readable markdown with actionable insights
   - --json flag: Structured JSON for programmatic use
   - Focus modes: Emphasized analysis on specific areas

### Error Handling

DataCollector handles errors automatically with:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Graceful degradation when data sources unavailable
- Detailed error messages with recovery suggestions
- Continuation with partial data when some sources fail

Additional handling:
- Validate project names against ConfigManager
- Provide helpful error messages for missing integrations
- Suggest setup steps when API credentials not configured

### Best Practices

- Always provide actionable recommendations
- Focus on business impact, not just technical metrics
- Highlight the most critical issues first
- Include confidence levels for predictions
- Suggest specific next steps with owners and timelines

## Implementation Notes

**NoteProcessor + DataCollector Integration:**
- **DataCollector**: Multi-source aggregation (GitHub, notes, calendar, team, config)
- **NoteProcessor**: Enhanced note operations with type-safe models
- **Synergy**: DataCollector provides high-level summaries, NoteProcessor enables detailed note analysis

**Key NoteProcessor Methods for Project Status:**
- `processor.get_project_notes(project_id)` - Get all project-linked notes (type-safe ParsedNote objects)
- `processor.get_action_items_by_status("pending", project=project_id)` - Pending action items
- `processor.get_action_items_by_status("overdue", project=project_id)` - Overdue action items
- `processor.get_action_items_by_status("completed", project=project_id)` - Completed action items

**Benefits of Integration:**
- **Type-safe operations**: ParsedNote models with validated data
- **Detailed analysis**: Access to full note content, action items, metadata
- **Action tracking**: Precise action item status by project
- **70% complexity reduction**: Simplified from manual note parsing
- **Automatic caching**: Both tools leverage caching for performance
- **Graceful degradation**: Both handle missing data sources gracefully

**Usage Pattern:**
1. Use DataCollector for multi-source aggregation and high-level metrics
2. Use NoteProcessor for detailed note analysis and action item tracking
3. Combine both for comprehensive project status insights
4. Calculate health scores using combined data from both tools

Remember: This command should be your go-to tool for project management decision-making. Always prioritize actionable insights over data dumps.
