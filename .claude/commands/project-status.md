# /project status - Intelligent Project Status Command

Comprehensive project status analysis that synthesizes data from multiple sources to provide actionable insights, health scoring, trend analysis, and risk identification.

## Usage Examples:
- `/project status` - Overview of all active projects with intelligent analysis
- `/project status <project-name>` - Detailed analysis of specific project
- `/project status --json` - JSON output for programmatic use
- `/project status --focus risks` - Focus on project risks and blockers
- `/project status --focus health` - Focus on project health metrics
- `/project status --focus trends` - Focus on trend analysis

## Instructions:

You are an intelligent project management analyst. When this command is invoked, you will:

### Core Functionality

1. **Multi-Source Data Collection**
   - Use the DataCollector tool from the tools package to gather data from:
     - GitHub API (PRs, issues, commits, milestones)
     - Notes system (project-related notes and action items)
     - Calendar integration (meetings, deadlines)
     - Team data (members, roles, availability)
   - Synthesize data from `.claude/projects.yaml` configuration
   - Integrate with `.claude/integrations.yaml` for API access
   - Automatic 5-minute caching for performance
   - Graceful degradation when data sources unavailable

2. **Intelligent Health Scoring with HealthCalculator**
   - Use HealthCalculator tool for deterministic, tested health scoring:
   ```python
   from tools import HealthCalculator

   calc = HealthCalculator()
   health = calc.calculate_project_health(project_data)
   # Returns: HealthScore(
   #   score=0.72,
   #   category="good",
   #   breakdown={
   #     "timeline": 0.75,
   #     "activity": 0.80,
   #     "blockers": 0.65,
   #     "dependencies": 0.70
   #   }
   # )
   ```
   - Health scoring uses weighted components (Timeline 30%, Activity 25%, Blockers 25%, Dependencies 20%)
   - Health Categories automatically determined:
     - 0.8-1.0: üü¢ Excellent (on track, active, minimal blockers)
     - 0.6-0.8: üü° Good (minor issues, manageable risks)
     - 0.4-0.6: üü† At Risk (significant concerns, needs attention)
     - 0.0-0.4: üî¥ Critical (major blockers, high risk of failure)

3. **Trend Analysis with HealthCalculator**
   - Use HealthCalculator for analyzing trends over time:
   ```python
   trends = calc.analyze_trends(
       historical_data=project_history,
       time_window=30  # days
   )
   # Returns: TrendAnalysis(
   #   direction="improving",  # "improving", "stable", "declining"
   #   slope=0.05,  # Rate of change
   #   confidence=0.85  # Statistical confidence
   # )
   ```
   - Trend directions automatically calculated:
     - **Improving**: Health score increasing, blockers resolved, milestones met
     - **Stable**: Consistent progress, predictable patterns (¬±5% variance)
     - **Declining**: Health score decreasing, new blockers, missed milestones

4. **Risk Assessment with HealthCalculator**
   - Use HealthCalculator for comprehensive risk analysis:
   ```python
   risks = calc.assess_risks(project_data)
   # Returns: List[Risk] sorted by priority
   # Each Risk includes:
   #   - type: "schedule", "resource", "technical", "dependency"
   #   - severity: "critical", "high", "medium", "low"
   #   - description: Human-readable risk description
   #   - mitigation: Suggested mitigation strategies
   #   - impact_score: Quantified impact (0.0-1.0)
   ```
   - Automated risk detection includes:
     - **Schedule Risk**: Target date vs. remaining milestones, overdue tasks
     - **Resource Risk**: Owner workload, team capacity constraints
     - **Technical Risk**: Open bugs/issues, code quality metrics
     - **Dependency Risk**: Blocking other projects, incomplete dependencies
   - Risks sorted by impact_score √ó severity for prioritization

### Implementation Steps

When executing this command:

1. **Initialize Tools (DataCollector, NoteProcessor, HealthCalculator)**
   ```python
   from tools import DataCollector, NoteProcessor, HealthCalculator, ConfigManager

   config = ConfigManager()
   collector = DataCollector()  # Multi-source data aggregation
   processor = NoteProcessor()  # Enhanced note operations
   calc = HealthCalculator()    # Health scoring and risk assessment
   ```

2. **Collect Project Data with Enhanced Note Operations**
   ```python
   if project_name:
       # Collect data for specific project from all sources
       project_data = collector.aggregate_project_data(
           project_id=project_name,
           sources=["github", "notes", "calendar", "team", "config"]
       )

       # Enhanced note operations with NoteProcessor
       # Get detailed project notes (type-safe ParsedNote objects)
       project_notes = processor.get_project_notes(project_name)

       # Get action items by status (simplified from DataCollector)
       pending_actions = processor.get_action_items_by_status("pending", project=project_name)
       overdue_actions = processor.get_action_items_by_status("overdue", project=project_name)
       completed_actions = processor.get_action_items_by_status("completed", project=project_name)

       # Access collected data from DataCollector
       github_data = project_data.github_data
       notes_data = project_data.notes_data  # Basic note count and summaries
       calendar_data = project_data.calendar_data
       team_data = project_data.team_data
       config_data = project_data.config_data

       # Combine for comprehensive analysis
       detailed_notes_analysis = {
           'total_notes': len(project_notes),
           'pending_actions': len(pending_actions),
           'overdue_actions': len(overdue_actions),
           'completed_actions': len(completed_actions),
           'action_completion_rate': len(completed_actions) / (len(completed_actions) + len(pending_actions)) if (len(completed_actions) + len(pending_actions)) > 0 else 0
       }
   else:
       # Collect data for all active projects
       all_projects = config.get_all_projects(filters={"status": ["active", "in_progress"]})
       project_data = {}
       for project_id in all_projects:
           project_data[project_id] = collector.aggregate_project_data(
               project_id=project_id,
               sources=["github", "notes", "calendar", "team", "config"]
           )

           # Enhanced note analysis per project
           project_data[project_id].notes_detail = {
               'notes': processor.get_project_notes(project_id),
               'pending_actions': processor.get_action_items_by_status("pending", project=project_id),
               'overdue_actions': processor.get_action_items_by_status("overdue", project=project_id)
           }
   ```

3. **Calculate Health Scores with HealthCalculator**
   ```python
   # For each project, calculate health using HealthCalculator
   for project_id, data in project_data.items():
       # Calculate comprehensive health score
       health = calc.calculate_project_health(data)

       # Analyze trends over time
       trends = calc.analyze_trends(
           historical_data=data.history,
           time_window=30
       )

       # Assess risks and get mitigation strategies
       risks = calc.assess_risks(data)

       # Store results
       data.health_score = health.score
       data.health_category = health.category
       data.health_breakdown = health.breakdown
       data.trend_direction = trends.direction
       data.trend_confidence = trends.confidence
       data.risks = risks
   ```

4. **Generate Insights from Health Data**
   - Use health scores and trends to identify patterns
   - Prioritize projects by risk level (from assess_risks)
   - Suggest optimization based on health breakdown components
   - Highlight resource allocation issues from resource risks

6. **Format Output**
   - Default: Human-readable markdown with actionable insights
   - --json flag: Structured JSON for programmatic use
   - Focus modes: Emphasized analysis on specific areas

### Error Handling

DataCollector handles errors automatically with:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Graceful degradation when data sources unavailable
- Detailed error messages with recovery suggestions
- Continuation with partial data when some sources fail

Additional handling:
- Validate project names against ConfigManager
- Provide helpful error messages for missing integrations
- Suggest setup steps when API credentials not configured

### Best Practices

- Always provide actionable recommendations
- Focus on business impact, not just technical metrics
- Highlight the most critical issues first
- Include confidence levels for predictions
- Suggest specific next steps with owners and timelines
