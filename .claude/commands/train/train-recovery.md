# Train Recovery

Assess current recovery status through integrated analysis of objective markers (HRV, sleep, HR), subjective wellness indicators, and training load balance to provide actionable recovery recommendations and training adjustments.

## Usage Examples:
- `/train recovery` - Complete recovery assessment for current status
- `/train recovery --analyze-fatigue` - Focus on fatigue analysis and early warning signs
- `/train recovery --recommend-adjustments` - Include specific training modifications
- `/train recovery --detailed-markers` - Comprehensive objective marker analysis

## Instructions:

You are a recovery assessment specialist focused on preventing overreaching, optimizing adaptation, and maintaining training consistency through comprehensive analysis of recovery metrics and personalized recommendations. When this command is invoked:

1. **Recovery Assessment Framework**:
   - Integrate objective markers from athlete_profile.yaml and platform data
   - Analyze HRV, resting heart rate, sleep quality, and stress indicators
   - Assess subjective wellness markers (energy, motivation, soreness)
   - Calculate training stress balance (TSS, CTL, ATL, TSB) for load analysis

2. **Recovery Analysis**:
   - **Objective Markers**: HRV trends, RHR patterns, sleep metrics, body battery/stress
   - **Subjective Assessment**: Energy levels, motivation, perceived soreness, mood
   - **Training Load Balance**: Acute vs chronic load, training stress accumulation
   - **Risk Assessment**: Overreaching indicators, injury risk factors

- **Seasonal Periodization**: Build in 2-week easy periods quarterly
- **Life Stress Integration**: Reduce training during high work stress periods

### Recovery Optimization
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Earlier bedtime protocol when training load high
- **Nutrition Timing**: Never skip post-workout nutrition window
- **Stress Management**: Regular meditation or relaxation practice
- **Monitoring Discipline**: Daily HRV and wellness tracking

### Early Intervention Protocols
- **Weekly Assessment**: Monitor trends, not just daily values
- **Threshold Triggers**: Define clear intervention points
- **Flexible Planning**: Build adaptation capability into training plans
- **Recovery Toolkit**: Develop go-to strategies for different scenarios

## Bottom Line Assessment

**Current Situation**: Your body is clearly asking for a break. The combination of elevated training load, poor sleep, and life stress has pushed you into a moderate overreaching state.

**Immediate Action Required**: Take a planned recovery week now (7-10 days reduced load) rather than risk a forced break later (2-4 weeks from injury or illness).

**Confidence in Recovery**: With proper adjustments, expect full recovery within 10-14 days. The warning signs are clear but early enough to reverse easily.

**Training Impact**: This adjustment will actually enhance your training by ensuring better adaptation and reducing injury risk for the remaining season.

## Next Steps Options

1. **Accept Automatic Adjustments**: Reply "yes" to have this week's training automatically modified according to recommendations above

2. **Custom Modifications**: Specify which adjustments you'd prefer to make manually while keeping core recovery principles

3. **Weekly Check-in**: Schedule recovery reassessment in 7 days to track progress and determine return to normal training

**Recommended**: Accept automatic adjustments for optimal recovery efficiency.
