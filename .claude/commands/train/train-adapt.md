# Train Adapt

Intelligently modify existing training plans based on performance improvements, life circumstances changes, and physiological adaptation responses with scientific progression principles.

## Usage Examples:
- `/train adapt` - Comprehensive plan adaptation based on recent data
- `/train adapt --performance breakthrough` - Adapt after breakthrough performance
- `/train adapt --life-change "new job, less time"` - Adapt to life circumstances
- `/train adapt --injury "minor calf strain"` - Adapt for injury management

## Instructions:

You are a training adaptation specialist focused on optimizing training plans based on real-world feedback and changing circumstances. When this command is invoked:

1. **Adaptation Assessment**:
   - Analyze recent training data and performance trends
   - Evaluate life circumstance changes and constraints
   - Assess physiological adaptation indicators
   - Review goal progress and timeline feasibility

2. **Adaptation Framework**:

- **Sharpening**: 6x800m at 3:50/km (faster to build speed reserve)
- **Taper**: Maintain intensity at new paces, reduce volume normally

## Alternative Adaptation Scenarios

### Scenario A: Conservative Progression
**Best for**: Risk-averse athletes, first-time goal attempt
- **Goal**: Maintain sub-3:00 target
- **Training**: Minor pace adjustments, focus on consistency
- **Advantage**: High confidence, reduced pressure
- **Timeline**: Continue original 28-week plan

### Scenario B: Moderate Progression
**Best for**: Experienced athletes, good adaptation history
- **Goal**: Upgrade to sub-2:57 (split the difference)
- **Training**: Gradual pace increases over 4 weeks
- **Advantage**: Appropriate challenge, manageable risk
- **Timeline**: Extend plan 2 weeks for extra adaptation

### Scenario C: Aggressive Progression
**Best for**: High-risk tolerance, competitive mindset
- **Goal**: Upgrade to sub-2:55 (4:10/km)
- **Training**: Immediate pace upgrades, increased volume
- **Advantage**: Maximizes current fitness potential
- **Timeline**: Possible plan extension for confidence building

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Adaptation Risks
- **Overconfidence**: One good performance doesn't guarantee consistency
- **Training Stress**: Faster paces increase injury risk
- **Pressure**: Higher goals create psychological pressure
- **Timeline**: May need more time to adapt to new paces

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Gradual Implementation**: Phase in new paces over 2-3 weeks
- **Monitoring**: Track RPE and HR response to faster paces
- **Flexibility**: Revert to original plan if adaptations cause issues
- **Testing**: Validate new paces with shorter time trials

### Success Indicators
- **Positive**: New paces feel manageable at target effort
- **Positive**: Heart rate response similar to previous paces
- **Positive**: Recovery normal after adapted sessions
- **Warning**: Excessive fatigue or inability to hit new paces

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 17: Validation Week
- **Monday**: Complete rest (breakthrough recovery)
- **Tuesday**: Test new marathon pace (20km at 4:10/km)
- **Thursday**: Test new threshold pace (3x10min at 4:00/km)
- **Assessment**: Evaluate RPE and HR response

### Week 18: Full Implementation
- **All Sessions**: Updated paces if Week 17 validation successful
- **Monitoring**: Close attention to recovery and adaptation
- **Backup Plan**: Revert to original paces if necessary

### Weeks 19-20: Confirmation
- **Training**: Full implementation of new training zones
- **Testing**: 25km marathon pace session as confidence builder
- **Decision Point**: Final goal confirmation before peak phase

## Physiological Adaptations Considered

### Positive Adaptation Indicators
- **Lactate Threshold**: Improved by ~5 seconds/km
- **Running Economy**: Same effort producing faster pace
- **Aerobic Power**: Sustained higher output in half marathon
- **Mental Strength**: Successful negative split execution

### Training Load Response
- **Current CTL**: 67 (Chronic Training Load)
- **Recent ATL**: 72 (Acute Training Load)
- **TSB**: -5 (optimal training stress balance)
- **Recommendation**: Maintain current load, adjust intensity only

## Alternative Training Focus Areas

### Option 1: Speed Development
- **Focus**: Build speed reserve above marathon pace
- **Sessions**: 200m-800m intervals at 3:30-3:50/km
- **Rationale**: Faster training improves marathon pace efficiency

### Option 2: Volume Optimization
- **Focus**: Increase weekly volume to 100km
- **Sessions**: Additional easy runs and longer aerobic sessions
- **Rationale**: Higher volume supports faster sustained pace

### Option 3: Race Simulation
- **Focus**: Practice executing 4:10/km in race conditions
- **Sessions**: Multiple 25-30km efforts at goal pace
- **Rationale**: Build confidence and pacing precision

## Monitoring Protocol

### Weekly Checkpoints
- **RPE Tracking**: New paces should feel similar to old paces after 2 weeks
- **Heart Rate**: Monitor for appropriate response to pace changes
- **Recovery**: Sleep, HRV, and motivation levels
- **Completion**: Ability to complete sessions as prescribed

### Monthly Assessment
- **Time Trial**: Validate fitness improvements with testing
- **Goal Review**: Confirm goal appropriateness based on training
- **Plan Adjustment**: Fine-tune based on adaptation response
- **Risk Evaluation**: Ongoing injury and overtraining assessment
