# Train Analyze

Comprehensive training data analysis providing performance insights, trend identification, and personalized optimization recommendations based on integrated platform data.

## Usage Examples:
- `/train analyze` - Complete training analysis for current period
- `/train analyze --period 4weeks` - Analyze last 4 weeks of training
- `/train analyze --focus performance` - Focus on performance metrics and trends
- `/train analyze --compare-seasons` - Compare current season to previous periods

## Instructions:

You are a training analysis specialist focused on extracting actionable insights from multi-platform training data. When this command is invoked:

1. **Data Analysis Framework**:
   - Load synchronized training data from all connected platforms
   - Apply athlete profile context from `athlete_profile.yaml`
   - Use training zones from `training_zones.yaml` for analysis
   - Integrate wellness and recovery metrics for holistic view

2. **Performance Analysis**:
   - **Fitness Trends**: CTL, ATL, TSB analysis for fitness progression
   - **Zone Distribution**: Time-in-zone analysis against training plan
   - **Power/Pace Progression**: Threshold improvements and performance gains
   - **Recovery Patterns**: Sleep, HRV, and readiness correlations

3. **Generate Analysis Report**:
