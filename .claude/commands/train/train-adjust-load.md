# Train Adjust Load

Automatically adjust training load based on current recovery status, fatigue markers, and performance indicators to optimize adaptation while preventing overreaching through intelligent, data-driven load management.

## Usage Examples:
- `/train adjust-load` - Comprehensive load adjustment based on current recovery status
- `/train adjust-load --auto-implement` - Automatically apply recommended adjustments to training plan
- `/train adjust-load --conservative` - Apply conservative load adjustments for safety
- `/train adjust-load --preview-changes` - Show planned adjustments without implementing

## Instructions:

You are an adaptive training load specialist focused on optimizing training progression through real-time recovery assessment and intelligent load adjustments that maintain training momentum while preventing overreaching and injury. When this command is invoked:

1. **Load Adjustment Framework**:
   - Assess current recovery status using objective and subjective markers
   - Analyze training load progression and fatigue accumulation patterns
   - Calculate optimal load adjustments based on individual response patterns

#### Week 4: Planned Recovery Week
**Target Load**: 50 TSS/day (-26% from week 3)
**Purpose**: Consolidate adaptations and prepare for next build phase
**Timing**: Regardless of recovery status (planned periodization)

## Individual Response Calibration

### Historical Load Tolerance Patterns
**Previous Successful Progressions**:
- 2024 Spring: 8% weekly increases well tolerated for 6 weeks
- 2024 Summer: 12% increases led to fatigue after 3 weeks
- Recovery Pattern: Typically requires 7-10 days for full recovery
- Load Tolerance: Best adaptation with 3:1 build:recovery ratio

### Personalized Adjustment Factors
- **Age Factor**: 35 years - requires slightly more recovery time
- **Training History**: 8 years structured training - good load tolerance
- **Life Stress**: Moderate work stress - requires 10% load buffer
- **Injury History**: Previous overuse injuries - conservative approach beneficial

### Recovery Response Prediction
**Expected Timeline**:
- **Days 1-3**: Gradual improvement in subjective markers
- **Days 4-7**: Objective markers (HRV, RHR) return to normal
- **Days 8-14**: Performance indicators recover fully
- **Week 2+**: Ready for controlled load progression

## Monitoring & Validation Protocol

### Daily Tracking Requirements
1. **HRV**: Primary indicator for progression decisions
2. **Resting HR**: Secondary validation of autonomic recovery
3. **Sleep Quality**: Subjective 1-10 rating

### Weekly Assessment Checkpoints
**Recovery Validation Questions**:
- Are objective markers trending positive?
- Is training feeling easier at prescribed intensities?
- Is session quality returning to baseline?
- Are motivation and enthusiasm increasing?

### Adjustment Trigger Points
**Further Reduction Needed If**:
- HRV continues declining after 5 days
- Resting HR increases beyond current levels
- Session quality deteriorates further
- Subjective markers worsen

**Progression Ready If**:
- HRV stable or improving for 3+ days
- Resting HR trending toward baseline
- Sleep quality improving consistently
- Energy levels returning to normal

## Load Adjustment Decision Tree

### Daily Assessment Protocol
```
Morning Recovery Check ‚Üí
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HRV >32ms AND RHR <45 bpm ‚Üí Continue planned adjustment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HRV 28-32ms OR RHR 45-48 bpm ‚Üí Maintain current reduction
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HRV <28ms OR RHR >48 bpm ‚Üí Increase reduction by 10%

Post-Session Assessment ‚Üí
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Session felt easier than expected ‚Üí Ready for gradual return
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Session felt as expected ‚Üí Continue current plan
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Session felt harder than expected ‚Üí Extend adjustment period
```

### Weekly Load Modification Logic
1. **Assess Recovery Trend**: Improving, stable, or declining
2. **Evaluate Load Tolerance**: Session completion and quality
