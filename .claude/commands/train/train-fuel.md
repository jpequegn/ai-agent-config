# Workout Fueling Strategy & Optimization

## Session Overview: ðŸŽ¯ Threshold Training (Lactate Threshold Development)

**Training Date**: 2024-09-19 (Tuesday)
**Session Type**: 2x20min @ Lactate Threshold (Zone 4)
**Duration**: 90 minutes total (45min warm-up/cool-down + 40min quality + 5min rest)
**Intensity Distribution**: 50% Zone 1-2, 44% Zone 4, 6% Zone 3
**Environmental Conditions**: 18Â°C, moderate humidity, indoor trainer

## Energy System Analysis

### Primary Energy Systems Utilized
**Session Energy Demands**:
- **Aerobic System**: 75% (sustained efforts, warm-up/cool-down)
- **Glycolytic System**: 23% (threshold intervals, transitions)
- **Phosphocreatine System**: 2% (initial efforts, neuromuscular activation)

**Substrate Utilization Targets**:
- **Carbohydrate Oxidation**: 65-70% at threshold intensity
- **Fat Oxidation**: 30-35% during easy portions
- **Training Adaptation**: Improve lactate clearance and buffering capacity

### Fuel Requirements Calculation
**Total Energy Expenditure**: 920 kcal
- **Warm-up/Cool-down (45min)**: 380 kcal (60% fat, 40% carbs)
- **Threshold Intervals (40min)**: 480 kcal (30% fat, 70% carbs)
- **Rest/Transition (5min)**: 60 kcal (50% fat, 50% carbs)

**Carbohydrate Demands**: 378 kcal = 95g carbohydrates
**Fat Oxidation**: 542 kcal = 60g fat (from body stores)

## Pre-Exercise Fueling Strategy

### Optimal Timing & Composition (3 hours before - 6:00 AM session)

#### 3-4 Hours Before (3:00 AM) - NOT RECOMMENDED
**Rationale**: Sleep disruption outweighs fueling benefits for 90-minute session
**Alternative**: Focus on proper dinner night before and morning fueling

#### Night Before Preparation (8:00 PM)
**Dinner Composition**:

**Goals**: Maintain blood glucose, spare muscle glycogen for intervals

### Fueling Decision Tree
**Sessions <60 minutes**: Water only, pre-exercise fueling sufficient
**Sessions 60-90 minutes**: 15-30g carbs/hour if morning session or glycogen depleted
**Sessions >90 minutes**: 30-60g carbs/hour, progressive intake

### Recommended Protocol (This Session)
