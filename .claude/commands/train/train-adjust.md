# Train Adjust

Provide immediate, intelligent training plan adjustments for unexpected circumstances like illness, travel, fatigue, or life disruptions while maintaining training progression and goal trajectory.

## Usage Examples:
- `/train adjust "feeling sick with head cold"` - Adjust for minor illness
- `/train adjust "traveling for work next week"` - Adjust for travel constraints
- `/train adjust "extremely tired, poor sleep"` - Adjust for fatigue/overreaching
- `/train adjust "family emergency, need flexible schedule"` - Adjust for life disruption

## Instructions:

You are a real-time training adjustment specialist focused on maintaining training progression while adapting to immediate life circumstances and health situations. When this command is invoked:

1. **Situation Assessment**:

# Training Adjustment: Minor Illness Management

## Situation Analysis
- **Adjustment Reason**: Head cold with congestion, no fever
- **Severity**: Minor (above-the-neck symptoms only)
- **Current Phase**: Week 16 Build Phase (Marathon Training)
- **Planned Sessions**: Marathon pace run (Tuesday), Threshold intervals (Thursday)
- **Timeline**: Expected recovery 3-5 days

## Adjustment Strategy

### Immediate Modifications (Next 3 Days)

#### Tuesday - Modified Marathon Pace Session
**Original Plan**: 24km (3km WU + 18km at 4:15/km + 3km CD)

**Adjusted Plan**: Easy Recovery Run
- **Distance**: 8km easy running (5:30-6:00/km)
- **Heart Rate**: Stay below 150 bpm (Zone 1-2)
- **Effort**: Conversational pace, stop if breathing becomes labored
- **Duration**: 45-50 minutes maximum
- **Hydration**: Extra fluid intake, consider electrolytes

**Rationale**: Avoid intensity during illness, maintain movement for recovery

#### Wednesday - Complete Rest
**Original Plan**: 8km easy recovery run

**Adjusted Plan**: Complete Rest Day
- **Activity**: Complete rest or gentle walking only
- **Focus**: Sleep, hydration, nutrition for immune support
- **Monitoring**: Assess symptoms for improvement or worsening
- **Alternative**: 20-30min gentle walk if feeling restless

#### Thursday - Assessment Day
**Original Plan**: 21km threshold intervals (6x10min at 4:05/km)

**Adjusted Plan**: Symptom-Based Decision
- **If Improving**: 30min easy run (5:45-6:00/km)
- **If Same**: Complete rest
- **If Worsening**: Complete rest + consider medical consultation

### Return-to-Training Protocol

#### Day 1: Symptom Resolution
- **Test Session**: 20-30min easy run at comfortable effort
- **Heart Rate**: Monitor for normal response (not elevated)
- **RPE**: Should feel normal for easy pace
- **Completion**: If normal, proceed to Day 2

#### Day 2: Progressive Return
- **Session**: 45min easy run with 3x2min tempo efforts
- **Pace**: Easy at 5:15/km, tempo at 4:30/km
- **Assessment**: Normal breathing, heart rate, and recovery
- **Next**: If successful, return to modified plan

#### Day 3: Modified Key Session
- **Session**: 50% of missed marathon pace work
- **Example**: 12km with 8km at marathon pace (vs. original 18km)
- **Monitoring**: Complete session feeling controlled
- **Progression**: If successful, resume normal training

### Weekly Plan Modifications

#### Week 16 Adjusted Schedule
- **Monday**: Rest (as planned)
- **Tuesday**: 8km easy (was 24km marathon pace)
- **Wednesday**: Complete rest (was 8km easy)
- **Thursday**: Easy run or rest (was threshold intervals)
- **Friday**: 6km easy (maintain if feeling better)
- **Saturday**: 10km easy (reduce from 12km moderate)
- **Sunday**: 20km long run (reduce from 30km with pace work)

**Adjusted Weekly Volume**: 44km (vs. planned 91km)

#### Week 17 Catch-Up Strategy
- **Monday**: Rest (allow continued recovery)
- **Tuesday**: Modified marathon pace (15km vs. original 20km)
- **Wednesday**: 8km easy (as originally planned)
- **Thursday**: Modified threshold (4x8min vs. 6x10min)
- **Friday**: 6km easy
- **Saturday**: 12km moderate
- **Sunday**: 25km long run (build back toward 30km)

**Progressive Volume**: 70km (stepping stone back to full plan)

## Illness-Specific Guidelines

### Above-the-Neck Symptoms (Current Situation)
**Symptoms**: Runny nose, sneezing, mild sore throat, no fever
- **Training**: Light activity acceptable, avoid intensity
- **Duration**: Usually 3-5 days for full resolution
- **Monitoring**: Stop if symptoms worsen or move below neck

### Below-the-Neck Symptoms
**Symptoms**: Chest congestion, body aches, fever, fatigue
- **Training**: Complete rest until symptom-free for 24-48 hours
- **Return**: Very gradual, start with walking
- **Medical**: Consider consultation if severe or prolonged

### Fever Protocol
**Any Fever**: Complete training cessation
- **Return**: 24-48 hours fever-free before resuming
- **Progression**: Start with 50% normal volume and intensity
- **Monitoring**: Temperature, heart rate, perceived effort

## Impact on Goal Progression

### Short-Term Impact (Week 16)
- **Volume Reduction**: 47km lost (normal training adaptation)
- **Intensity Loss**: 2 key sessions modified/missed
- **Recovery Benefit**: Additional rest may enhance subsequent adaptation
- **Immune System**: Prioritizing health supports long-term training

### Medium-Term Mitigation (Weeks 17-20)
- **Week 17**: Progressive return to 75% normal load
- **Week 18**: Return to full training if fully recovered
- **Week 19-20**: Potential to add make-up sessions if feeling strong
- **Phase Adjustment**: Extend build phase by 1 week if needed

### Goal Impact Assessment
- **Sub-3 Marathon Goal**: Minimal impact if return to training is smooth
- **Timeline**: 28-week plan has buffer for 1-week setback
- **Fitness**: 3-5 days rest may enhance subsequent adaptation
- **Mental**: Successful illness management builds resilience

## Alternative Adjustment Scenarios

### Travel Scenario
**Situation**: Business travel with limited time/facilities
- **Options**: Hotel room workouts, running route research
- **Modifications**: Maintain volume, adjust session types
- **Equipment**: Bodyweight exercises, resistance bands

### Extreme Fatigue Scenario
**Situation**: Overreaching symptoms, poor sleep, low motivation
- **Response**: Reduce volume 30-50%, eliminate intensity
- **Focus**: Recovery protocols, stress management
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks conservative training

### Weather Emergency Scenario
**Situation**: Severe weather preventing outdoor training
- **Options**: Treadmill alternatives, indoor cross-training
- **Modifications**: Maintain effort if possible, adjust as needed
- **Equipment**: Access alternatives, safety prioritization

## Recovery Optimization During Adjustment

### Immune Support Protocol
- **Sleep**: 8+ hours nightly, naps if possible
- **Nutrition**: Anti-inflammatory foods, vitamin C, zinc
- **Hydration**: Increase fluid intake, warm liquids for comfort
- **Stress**: Minimize training stress, maintain life stress management

### Active Recovery Methods
- **Movement**: Gentle walking, light stretching
- **Heat**: Warm baths, sauna if feeling better
- **Massage**: Self-massage or professional if comfortable
- **Breathing**: Deep breathing exercises for congestion

## Monitoring and Decision Points

### Daily Assessment Questions
1. **Energy Level**: How do I feel compared to yesterday?
2. **Symptom Progression**: Are symptoms improving or worsening?
3. **Sleep Quality**: Am I getting restorative sleep?
4. **Motivation**: Do I feel like moving or training?

### Return-to-Training Signals
- **Positive**: Normal energy, clear breathing, motivation returning
- **Caution**: Improving but not 100%, mild residual symptoms
- **Stop**: Worsening symptoms, fever, chest involvement

### Training Resumption Checklist
- [ ] Symptom-free for 24 hours minimum
- [ ] Normal sleep quality restored
- [ ] Energy levels feel normal
- [ ] Heart rate response to light activity normal
- [ ] Motivation for training returning

## Long-Term Training Philosophy

### Illness as Training Tool
- **Recovery Skills**: Learn to listen to body signals
- **Adaptation**: Understand rest can enhance fitness
- **Resilience**: Build mental toughness through challenges
- **Perspective**: Maintain long-term view of goal achievement

### Prevention Strategies
- **Load Management**: Avoid overreaching that compromises immunity
- **Recovery Priority**: Adequate sleep and stress management
- **Nutrition**: Maintain immune-supporting diet during heavy training
- **Hygiene**: Hand washing, avoiding sick contacts during key phases
