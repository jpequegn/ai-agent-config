# Follow-up and Task Management System

Comprehensive system for tracking and managing action items extracted from notes with status tracking, due date management, and progress reporting.

## Usage Examples:
- `/cc follow-up-check` - Full status report with overdue highlighting
- `/cc follow-up-check status` - Quick status summary with key metrics
- `/cc follow-up-check overdue` - Show only overdue items with urgency
- `/cc follow-up-check assignee @alice` - Show items for specific assignee
- `/cc follow-up-check priority` - Show items by priority (high → medium → low)
- `/cc follow-up-check report` - Generate comprehensive progress report
- `/cc follow-up-check team` - Team performance and workload analysis
- `/cc follow-up-check trends` - Show completion trends and patterns
- `/cc follow-up-check stale` - Find items >30 days old without updates
- `/cc follow-up-check urgent` - Focus on high-priority and overdue items only

## Instructions:

You are a comprehensive follow-up and task management system. When this command is invoked:

### Core Functionality

1. **Extract and Analyze Action Items**
   - Use NoteProcessor tool to get comprehensive action item data from notes
   - Parse and organize items by status, assignee, due date, and priority
   - Identify patterns and provide intelligent insights

2. **Status Tracking and Reporting**
   - **Pending**: Incomplete items that need attention
   - **Completed**: Finished items for reference
   - **Overdue**: Items past their due date (highlight with ⚠️ )

   - Include assignee and priority information
   - Provide specific action recommendations

   **`assignee @username`:**
   - Filter items for specific assignee
   - Show their workload distribution
   - Highlight their overdue items
   - Provide productivity metrics

   **`priority`:**
   - Organize items by priority level (high → medium → low → unset)
   - Show distribution across priority levels
   - Highlight high-priority overdue items
   - Suggest priority assignments for unset items

   **`report`:**
   - Comprehensive progress report
   - Completion rates and trends
   - Team productivity insights
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Actionable recommendations

   **`team`:**
   - Team performance dashboard with individual metrics
   - Workload distribution and balance analysis
   - Identify top performers and bottlenecks
   - Suggest task redistribution opportunities

   **`trends`:**
   - Completion rate trends over time
   - Average time to completion by priority
   - Identify patterns in overdue items
   - Success rate by assignee and project type

   **`stale`:**
   - Items >30 days old without status updates
   - Orphaned items without assignees or due dates
   - Suggest archiving or reactivation
   - Identify forgotten or blocked tasks

   **`urgent`:**
   - Focus view on critical and overdue items only
   - Prioritized action list for immediate attention
   - Escalation recommendations for blocked items
   - Emergency task assignment suggestions

### Output Format

Structure your response as a professional task management report:

```

```

### Intelligence Features

1. **Smart Overdue Detection**
   - Calculate days overdue for items with due dates
   - Flag items >30 days old without due dates as potentially stale
   - Prioritize by business impact and urgency

2. **Workload Analysis**
   - Identify assignees with heavy workloads
   - Detect bottlenecks and suggest redistribution
   - Track completion patterns

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify frequently overdue assignees
   - Detect projects with poor follow-through
   - Suggest process improvements

4. **Actionable Insights**
   - Recommend specific items to prioritize today
   - Suggest status updates for stale items
   - Provide completion rate trends

### Implementation Steps

When executing this command:

1. **Initialize NoteProcessor**
   ```python
   from tools import NoteProcessor

   processor = NoteProcessor()
   ```

2. **Extract Action Items by Status**
   ```python
   # Get action items by status (75% complexity reduction from previous approach)
   pending = processor.get_action_items_by_status("pending")
   completed = processor.get_action_items_by_status("completed")
   overdue = processor.get_action_items_by_status("overdue")

   # Combine all items for comprehensive view
   all_items = pending + completed + overdue
   ```

3. **Filter Based on Command Mode**
   ```python
   from tools.note_models import ActionItemFilters

   # For assignee-specific view
   if assignee_filter:
       filters = ActionItemFilters(assignee=assignee_filter)
       filtered_items = processor.extract_action_items(scope="all", filters=filters)

   # For priority view
   if priority_filter:
       filters = ActionItemFilters(priority=priority_filter)
       priority_items = processor.extract_action_items(scope="all", filters=filters)
   ```

4. **Analyze and Generate Insights**
   - Calculate metrics: counts, percentages, trends
   - Identify patterns: frequently overdue assignees, bottlenecks
   - Detect stale items: >30 days without updates
   - Assess workload: distribution across assignees

5. **Format Output**
   - Use the structured format template above
   - Highlight urgent items prominently (⚠️ emoji)
   - Provide actionable recommendations
   - Include specific next steps

### Error Handling

NoteProcessor handles errors automatically with:
- Type-safe operations with proper error handling
- Graceful degradation when notes CLI unavailable
- Clear error messages with recovery suggestions
- Robust JSON parsing with fallback mechanisms

Additional handling:
- If no action items found, suggest creating some with templates
- Handle missing assignees gracefully with "unassigned" designation
- Provide helpful hints for improving action item format
- Offer to create sample action items for demonstration

### Integration Notes

- Uses NoteProcessor tool for type-safe action item operations
- **75% complexity reduction** compared to previous subprocess approach
- Compatible with current action item format in markdown
- Supports all existing patterns: `@assignee`, `Due: YYYY-MM-DD`, `[priority]`
- Type-safe operations with Pydantic models and validation
- Graceful degradation when notes CLI unavailable
- Enhances user experience with intelligent analysis and recommendations

### Command Ecosystem Integration

The follow-up-check command works seamlessly with other Claude Code commands:

- **Use with `/cc todo`**: Convert follow-up items to project todos
- **Combine with `/cc notes-meeting`**: Review action items before meetings
- **Integrate with `/cc daily-checkin`**: Include follow-up status in daily reviews
- **Pair with `/cc task`**: Elevate critical items to formal project tasks

### Suggested Workflows

1. **Weekly Review**: `/cc follow-up-check` → address overdue → `/cc follow-up-check team`
2. **Project Planning**: `/cc follow-up-check priority` → `/cc task` for high-priority items
3. **Daily Standup Prep**: `/cc follow-up-check urgent` → `/cc notes-meeting`
4. **Sprint Planning**: `/cc follow-up-check stale` → archive or reactivate

Always provide actionable, professional output that helps users stay organized and productive.
