```python
output = formatter.format_markdown(
    data=action_items_data,
    template="follow_up_report",
    context={"focus": focus_mode}  # 'overdue', 'urgent', 'team', etc.
)
print(output.content)
```

**Template Features:**
- Status indicators with emojis (✅ pending, ✅ completed, ⚠️ overdue)
- Action items grouped by owner with workload distribution
- Progress metrics (completion rate, on-time rate, average age)
- Attention required section highlighting overdue and blocked items
- Upcoming deadlines with date formatting

### Implementation Steps

When executing this command:

1. **Initialize Tools (NoteProcessor and OutputFormatter)**
   ```python
   from tools import NoteProcessor, OutputFormatter

   processor = NoteProcessor()  # Enhanced note operations with type-safe models
   formatter = OutputFormatter()  # Template-based output generation
   ```

2. **Extract Action Items by Status**
   ```python
   # Get action items by status (75% complexity reduction from previous approach)
   pending = processor.get_action_items_by_status("pending")
   completed = processor.get_action_items_by_status("completed")
   overdue = processor.get_action_items_by_status("overdue")

   # Combine all items for comprehensive view
   all_items = pending + completed + overdue
   ```

3. **Filter Based on Command Mode**
   ```python
   from tools.note_models import ActionItemFilters

   # For assignee-specific view
   if assignee_filter:
       filters = ActionItemFilters(assignee=assignee_filter)
       filtered_items = processor.extract_action_items(scope="all", filters=filters)

   # For priority view
   if priority_filter:
       filters = ActionItemFilters(priority=priority_filter)
       priority_items = processor.extract_action_items(scope="all", filters=filters)
   ```

4. **Analyze and Generate Insights**
   ```python
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   # Calculate metrics
   total_items = len(all_items)
   completed_items = len(completed)
   completion_rate = completed_items / total_items if total_items > 0 else 0

   # Identify overdue items
   overdue_count = len(overdue)

   # Group by owner
   by_owner = {}
   for item in all_items:
       owner = item.assignee or "Unassigned"
       if owner not in by_owner:
           by_owner[owner] = []
       by_owner[owner].append(item)

   # Identify attention-required items
   attention_required = []
   for item in overdue:
       attention_required.append({
           "title": item.description,
           "reason": f"{(datetime.now() - item.due_date).days} days overdue"
       })

   # Get upcoming deadlines (next 7 days)
   upcoming = [item for item in pending if item.due_date and
               0 <= (item.due_date - datetime.now()).days <= 7]
   ```

5. **Format Output with OutputFormatter**
   ```python
   # Prepare data structure for template
   action_items_data = {
       "action_items": all_items,
       "metrics": {
           "completion_rate": completion_rate,
           "on_time_rate": 0.80,  # Calculate based on completion history
           "average_age_days": 12,  # Calculate from creation dates
           "overdue_count": overdue_count
       },
       "by_owner": by_owner,
       "attention_required": attention_required,
       "upcoming_deadlines": upcoming
   }

   # Use OutputFormatter for consistent template-based output
   if json_flag:
       # JSON output for programmatic use
       output = formatter.format_json(action_items_data, pretty=True)
   else:
       # Markdown output using follow_up_report template
       output = formatter.format_markdown(
           data=action_items_data,
           template="follow_up_report",
           context={"focus": focus_mode}  # 'overdue', 'urgent', 'team', etc.
       )

   print(output.content)

   # Performance tracking
   print(f"<!-- Rendered in {output.processing_time_ms:.2f}ms -->")
   ```
