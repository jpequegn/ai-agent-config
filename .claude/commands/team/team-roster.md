### Implementation Steps

**1. Initialize DataCollector:**
```python
from tools import DataCollector

collector = DataCollector()
```

**2. Collect Team Data:**
```python
# Get team data for specific project
team_data = collector.collect_team_data(
    project="mobile-app-v2",
    include_performance=False
)

# Access team members
members = team_data.members
roles = team_data.roles
```

**3. Display Team Roster:**
```python
# Iterate through team members
for member in members:
    member_id = member.get('id')
    member_name = member.get('name')
    member_role = member.get('role')
    member_email = member.get('email')
    member_status = member.get('status', 'active')

    # Display member information
    print(f"{member_name} ({member_email}) - {member_role}")
```

**4. Filter Members:**
```python
# Filter by role
senior_devs = [m for m in members if m.get('role') == 'Senior Developer']

# Filter by status
active_members = [m for m in members if m.get('status') == 'active']

# Filter by manager
team_leads_team = [m for m in members if m.get('manager') == 'jane.smith']
```

**5. Cross-Reference with Projects:**
```python
# Get comprehensive project data
data = collector.aggregate_project_data(
    project_id="mobile-app-v2",
    sources=["team", "config", "github"]
)

# Check member workload
for member in data.team_data.members:
    member_id = member['id']

    # Count active projects for this member
    member_projects = [
        p for p_id, p in data.config_data.projects.items()
        if member_id in p.get('team', [])
    ]

    print(f"{member['name']}: {len(member_projects)} active projects")
```

### Error Handling & Performance

**DataCollector Benefits:**
- **Automatic Caching**: 5-minute cache for team data
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry (3 attempts)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with partial data
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity

**Performance:**
- Response time: ~2s ‚Üí <500ms cached
- Efficient cross-project team queries

### Integration Notes
- **Primary Tool**: DataCollector for team data aggregation
- **Data Access**: Use `team_data.members` and `team_data.roles`
- **Validation**: Pydantic models provide automatic validation
- **Caching**: 5-minute automatic cache reduces repeated calls
- **Cross-Reference**: Easy integration with GitHub and notes data
