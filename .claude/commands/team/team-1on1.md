### Tool-Based Implementation

**Standard 1:1 Preparation** `/team 1on1-prep [email]`:

```python
from tools import TeamManager

# Initialize manager
manager = TeamManager()

# Prepare 1:1 meeting
meeting = manager.prepare_1on1(
    team_member_email="{email_from_command}",
    include_project_context=True  # Include project updates
)

# Output formatted meeting agenda
print(meeting.formatted_output)
```

**Meeting Notes Capture** `/team 1on1-notes [email]`:

```python
from tools import TeamManager, OutputFormatter
from datetime import datetime

manager = TeamManager()

# Capture meeting discussion
meeting_notes = {
    'participants': ['Manager', '{team_member_name}'],
    'date': datetime.now(),
    'duration': '45 minutes',

    'discussion_points': [
        {
            'topic': '{discussion_topic}',
            'notes': '{discussion_details}',
            'priority': 'high',  # high, medium, low
            'follow_up': '{follow_up_action}'
        }
    ],

    'accomplishments': [
        '{recent_accomplishment_1}',

    ],

    'goals': [
        {
            'title': '{goal_title}',
            'status': 'in_progress',  # completed, in_progress, blocked, pending
            'progress': 0.75,

    },

    'wellbeing': {
        'satisfaction': 0.85,  # 0.0-1.0

            'status': 'pending'
        }
    ]
}

# Format with OutputFormatter
formatter = OutputFormatter()
output = formatter.format_markdown(meeting_notes, template="team_1on1")
print(output.content)
```

**Follow-up Tracking** `/team 1on1-follow-up [email]`:

```python
from tools import TeamManager

manager = TeamManager()

# Get team member
team_member = manager._get_team_member("{email}")

# Check recent meeting notes for action items
# Filter for pending items assigned to team member
pending_actions = [
    {
        'action': '{action_from_previous_1on1}',
        'assigned': team_member.name,
        'deadline': '{deadline}',
        'status': 'pending',
        'meeting_date': '{original_1on1_date}'
    }
]

# Display pending follow-ups
print(f"## Follow-ups for {team_member.name}\n")
for action in pending_actions:
    status_icon = '⏳' if action['status'] == 'pending' else '✅'
    print(f"{status_icon} **{action['action']}**")
    print(f"   - Deadline: {action['deadline']}")
    print(f"   - From: {action['meeting_date']}\n")
```

**All Team Follow-ups** `/team 1on1-follow-up --all`:

```python
from tools import TeamManager

manager = TeamManager()

# Get all team members
team_members = manager._get_all_team_members()

# Aggregate all pending follow-ups
all_pending = {}
for member in team_members:
    # Get pending actions for each member
    member_actions = []  # Query meeting notes for pending items
    if member_actions:
        all_pending[member.name] = member_actions

# Display team-wide follow-ups
print("## Team-Wide 1:1 Follow-ups\n")
for member_name, actions in all_pending.items():
    print(f"### {member_name}")
    for action in actions:
        print(f"- {action['action']} (Due: {action['deadline']})")
    print()
```

**Trend Analysis** `/team 1on1-trends [email]`:

```python
from tools import TeamManager

manager = TeamManager()
team_member = manager._get_team_member("{email}")

# Analyze historical 1:1 notes for patterns
trends = {
    'recurring_challenges': [
        # Challenges mentioned in multiple 1:1s
        '{recurring_challenge_1}',
        '{recurring_challenge_2}'
    ],
    'goal_progression': {
        # Track goal completion over time
        '{goal_name}': {
            'start_progress': 0.3,
            'current_progress': 0.75,
            'trend': 'improving'
        }
    },
    'satisfaction_trend': {
        # Track satisfaction scores over time
        'average': 0.82,
        'trend': 'stable',
        'recent_scores': [0.80, 0.85, 0.82, 0.85]
    },
    'common_topics': [
        # Most frequently discussed topics
        '{topic_1}',
        '{topic_2}',
        '{topic_3}'
    ]
}

# Display trends
print(f"## 1:1 Trends for {team_member.name}\n")
print("### Recurring Challenges")
for challenge in trends['recurring_challenges']:
    print(f"- {challenge}")

print("\n### Goal Progression")
for goal, data in trends['goal_progression'].items():
    print(f"- **{goal}**: {data['start_progress']:.0%} → {data['current_progress']:.0%} ({data['trend']})")

print(f"\n### Satisfaction: {trends['satisfaction_trend']['average']:.0%} ({trends['satisfaction_trend']['trend']})")
```

### Output Templates

The TeamManager tool integrates with OutputFormatter and uses the `team_1on1.md.j2` template for professional 1:1 meeting formatting with:

- Meeting metadata (participants, date, duration)
- Agenda items and discussion points
- Accomplishments and goal progress
- Challenges and proposed solutions
- Career development discussion
- Wellbeing check-in
- Action items with owners and deadlines

### Best Practices

**Meeting Preparation**:
- Review previous 1:1 notes before meeting
- Include project context for relevant discussions
- Prepare specific questions based on team member's role
- Consider recent accomplishments and challenges

**Meeting Execution**:
- Start with check-in and general updates
- Discuss accomplishments and positive feedback
- Address challenges with problem-solving approach
- Dedicate time to career development
- End with clear action items and next steps

**Follow-up**:
- Track action items from each meeting
- Review progress in subsequent 1:1s
- Identify patterns in recurring themes
- Adjust meeting format based on team member preferences

**Privacy Considerations**:
- Handle sensitive career discussions confidentially
- Store meeting notes securely
- Respect team member privacy in wellbeing discussions
- Limit access to 1:1 notes appropriately
