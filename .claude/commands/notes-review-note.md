# Notes Review Note

Review individual notes with detailed analysis, PARA categorization, and cleanup options. Perfect for focused note processing and organization decisions.

## Usage Examples:
- `/notes review-note --file "inbox/meeting-notes.md"` - Review note with all options
- `/notes review-note --file "inbox/meeting-notes.md" --category projects` - Move note to projects
- `/notes review-note --file "inbox/research.md" --full-content` - Review with complete content

## Instructions:

You are a note review assistant for the PARA Method system. When this command is invoked:

1. **Parse the file parameter**:
   - Extract the file path from user input
   - Handle both absolute and relative paths
   - Support natural language like "the meeting note" or "that research file"

2. **Determine the action** based on parameters:
   - No action specified: Provide review options and analysis
   - `--category specified`: Move note to PARA category
   - `--full-content`: Include complete note content for detailed review

3. **For review analysis (default)**:
   - Show note summary with content preview
   - Display action items and their status
   - Provide AI-suggested PARA category with reasoning
   - List available actions and category options

4. **For categorization actions**:
   - Move note to specified PARA category directory
   - Create category directories if needed
   - Confirm successful moves with new location
   - Provide undo options for recent moves

5. **Handle user responses conversationally**:
   - "Move this to projects" → Add --category projects
   - "Show me the full content" → Add --full-content
   - "Actually, put it in areas instead" → Execute new categorization

6. **Execute command**: Use the notes script with appropriate parameters:
   ```bash
   ./notes review-note --file [path] [options]
   ```

7. **Return structured JSON** with:
   - Note analysis and metadata
   - Content preview or full content
   - Action items and their details
   - Category suggestions with confidence
   - Available actions and next steps

## Review Analysis Details:

### Note Metadata
- File path and title
- Word count and estimated reading time
- Creation date and last modified
- Current PARA location

### Content Analysis
- Content preview (500 characters) or full content
- Action items with completion status
- Identified attendees, dates, and tags
- Key topics and themes

### PARA Category Suggestions
- Suggested category with confidence score
- Reasoning for the suggestion
- Alternative category options
- Category-specific benefits

### Available Actions
- **Categorize**: Move to projects, areas, resources, or archive
- **Edit**: Open in editor for content changes
- **Delete**: Remove note (with confirmation)
- **Skip**: Keep in current location for now

## Parameters:
- `--file PATH` - Note file to review (required)
- `--category CATEGORY` - Move to PARA category (projects, areas, resources, archive)
- `--full-content` - Include complete note content in response
- `--undo-move` - Undo previous move operation (planned feature)

## PARA Category Guidelines:

**Projects** - Specific outcomes with deadlines:
- Meeting notes for specific project initiatives
- Research for deliverables with timelines
- Planning documents for defined outcomes

**Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities to maintain:
- Regular meeting series (1:1s, team meetings)
- Process documentation and procedures
- Maintenance and operational notes

**Resources** - Future reference materials:
- Research without specific application
- Reference materials and documentation
- Learning notes and knowledge capture

**Archive** - Inactive items from other categories:
- Completed project notes
- Outdated processes and procedures
- Historical reference materials

## Conversational Flow Examples:

**User**: "Review the sprint planning meeting note"
**Response**:
1. Identify file: Search for files matching "sprint planning meeting"
2. Execute: `/notes review-note --file [identified_path]`
3. Present analysis with category suggestion
4. Ask: "This looks like project planning. Should I move it to projects?"

**User**: "Show me the full content first"
**Response**:
1. Execute: `/notes review-note --file [path] --full-content`
2. Display complete note content
3. Provide analysis and suggestions
4. Offer categorization options

**User**: "Yes, move it to projects"
**Response**:
1. Execute: `/notes review-note --file [path] --category projects`
2. Confirm: "✅ Moved to projects/[filename]"
3. Suggest: "You can view it at the new location or continue reviewing other notes"

**User**: "Actually, that should be in areas instead"
**Response**:
1. Execute move to areas category
2. Confirm updated location
3. Note: "✅ Moved from projects to areas. You can undo this later if needed"

## Behavior:
- Always output JSON for Claude Code integration
- Handle file path variations (relative, absolute, partial matches)
- Provide clear reasoning for category suggestions
- Support natural language interaction for file selection
- Track and offer undo operations for moves
- Handle missing files gracefully with alternatives

## Error Handling:
- File not found: Offer to search for similar files or list inbox contents
- Invalid category: Show valid category options with descriptions
- Permission errors: Guide through permission resolution
- Malformed notes: Provide graceful handling with partial analysis

## Integration Notes:
- Works seamlessly with `/notes process-inbox --interactive`
- Supports undo operations for workflow flexibility
- Provides detailed analysis for informed categorization decisions
- Handles both automated and manual note processing workflows

Be thorough in analysis, clear in suggestions, and supportive in helping users make good PARA organization decisions.
