### Data Flow

1. **User Input** → Natural language command with arguments
2. **SmartQueryParser** → Parses query, extracts entities and filters
3. **NLPProcessor** → Handles NLP-specific tasks (dates, intents, fuzzy matching)
4. **ConfigManager** → Provides entity candidates for fuzzy matching
5. **Domain Tools** → Use parsed data for domain-specific operations
6. **Output** → Structured response to user

### Key Design Decisions

**Why SmartQueryParser?**
- Abstracts NLPProcessor complexity for command authors
- Provides domain-specific entity resolution
- Centralizes fuzzy matching logic
- Enables consistent suggestion generation

**Why Separate fuzzy_lookup?**
- Reusable across all tools and commands
- Independent testing and optimization
- Clear separation of concerns (matching vs. parsing)

**Why Keep NLPProcessor Core?**
- Battle-tested logic (49 tests, 93% coverage)
- Framework-agnostic design
- Easy to extend with new patterns
- Minimal dependencies
