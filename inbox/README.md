# Inbox

This directory serves as a temporary holding area for unprocessed notes and materials.

## Purpose
- Capture everything quickly without worrying about organization
- Process regularly to move items to appropriate PARA folders
- Keep this folder empty through regular review

## Processing Guidelines
1. Review inbox items regularly (daily/weekly)
2. Categorize each item into Projects, Areas, Resources, or Archive
3. Move items to appropriate folders
4. Delete items that are no longer relevant

## File Naming
- Use timestamps for quick capture: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM_topic.md`
- Include source if relevant: `meeting_`, `idea_`, `article_`, etc.
